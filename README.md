# MAL Scraper
A Python web scraper for retrieving anime data from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
Scrapes all relevant data for each requested anime title and saves it as a CSV spreadsheet.

## Installation

Install the Python distribution and Python packages listed below in Prerequisites.
Download [anime_scraper.py](./anime_scraper.py) to your computer.
Follow the usage guide to start using the Python script.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [certifi](https://pypi.org/project/certifi/)
- [beautifulsoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

##  Usage
Command-line arguments and usage are listed below. Most of the search options correspond
to equivalent options in MyAnimeList's own online search function.

It is **highly recommended** that the `retry-pause` and `delay` options are left on
default, or even increased, so as to reduce the strain on MyAnimeList's servers and
prevent you from being blocked or registered as a DDOS attack (Can't guarantee
that it will happen, but also won't guarantee that it won't).
